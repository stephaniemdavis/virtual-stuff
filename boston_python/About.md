On July 19, 2016, I presented a 5 minute lightning talk on Virtual Environments to the Boston Python Meetup group.
The files ned_first.png and ned_second.png are the slides I used for the presentation.
The ned_sudo_pip.pdf file is a summary of Ned's January 2016 overview of the dangers of using the "sudo-pip" command sequence. He recommended Virtual Environments as an alternative.
V.E's also have the advantage of being easy to create, remove and port from one environment to the next.
